# ICU Mortality Prediction Using Neural Network

## Introduction
This project aims to predict in-hospital mortality for ICU patients using a neural network model. The dataset contains various physiological metrics and patient characteristics. Early identification of patients at risk of death in the ICU is crucial for timely intervention, which can improve healthcare outcomes.

## Rationale
ICU mortality prediction is a vital task in critical care. By leveraging machine learning, especially neural networks, we aim to create a robust model that assists healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients early, thus reducing mortality rates through timely interventions.

## Strategies Used

### Data Exploration and Visualization
- A comprehensive dataset overview, including a missing value analysis, helps identify gaps that could affect model performance.
- Visualizations of the mortality distribution and analysis of the target class (`In-hospital_death`) reveal class imbalance, a common challenge in healthcare datasets.

### Data Cleaning
- Missing values are handled carefully, especially given the nature of physiological parameters where data might be incomplete due to sensor failures or skipped measurements.

### Feature Engineering
- Features are created or transformed from vital signs, lab values, and demographic data to improve model performance.

### Model Selection
- A neural network model was chosen for its ability to capture non-linear relationships and handle high-dimensional data. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning strategies were employed to optimize performance.

## Tools or Technologies Used

### Python Libraries
- `pandas` and `numpy` for data preprocessing and manipulation.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization.
- `scikit-learn` for train-test split, scaling, and evaluation metrics.
- `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch` for building the deep learning model.

### Data Processing
- Handling missing values and standardizing the continuous variables.
- Dealing with class imbalance, potentially using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

## Concepts or Algorithms Used

### Neural Network
- A feed-forward neural network to predict the binary outcome (`In-hospital_death`). The model architecture captures complex patterns in the physiological data using layers and activation functions like ReLU to introduce non-linearity.

### Binary Classification
- The problem is formulated as a binary classification task, where the model predicts the probability of patient mortality based on physiological parameters.

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) are used to assess the model. These metrics help evaluate the model’s ability to correctly predict high-risk patients while minimizing false positives.

## Why These Techniques?
- **Neural Networks** are capable of modeling complex, non-linear relationships in medical data, making them well-suited for ICU mortality prediction.
- **Class Imbalance** is handled to ensure that the model doesn’t favor the majority class, which is critical for healthcare applications where identifying rare outcomes like mortality is crucial.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and visualizations are key steps in understanding data distributions, missingness, and preparing it for modeling.
